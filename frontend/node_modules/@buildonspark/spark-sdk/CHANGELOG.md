# @buildonspark/spark-sdk

## 0.7.13

### Patch Changes

- - Improve Bare transport reconnect behavior by relying on event stream heartbeats instead of cancelling long-lived streams when unrelated requests time out.
- - Renew low-timelock leaves returned from swaps before caching them to avoid later swap-signing failures.

## 0.7.12

### Patch Changes

- Fixes

## 0.7.11

### Patch Changes

- - Improve compatibility with newer Bare runtimes by updating Bare runtime dependencies and removing obsolete request socket listener handling.

## 0.7.10

### Patch Changes

- - Fix Bare transport timeouts so hung requests tear down stuck response streams instead of leaving wallet connections wedged after network drops.
  - Keep wallet background event streams retrying until cleanup, with reconnect events that reflect unbounded retry behavior for long-lived clients.

## 0.7.9

### Patch Changes

- - Fix Bare transport recovery after network drops so wallet event streams reconnect instead of getting stuck on half-open requests.

## 0.7.8

### Patch Changes

- Add `SparkWallet.getOrCreateWallet()` so apps can reuse a single wallet instance per identity and avoid duplicate background streams and claims.
- Add typed `TreeNodeStatus` values and `executeBefore` support to the generated Spark protocol types.
- Return a transport error when bare unary requests time out instead of leaving them pending indefinitely.

## 0.7.7

### Patch Changes

- Rename the manual wallet sync escape hatch to `experimental_syncWallet()` and keep `syncWallet()` internal.

## 0.7.6

### Patch Changes

- Add `execute_before` field to token transaction protos, enabling offline multisig flows with client-signed deadlines
- Export `KeyDerivationType` as a value instead of only as a type, allowing consumers to access the enum values at runtime
- Fix lightning send to correctly pass `amountSatsToSend` for zero-amount invoices, preventing leaves from being locked for zero-value payments
- Temporarily expose syncWallet

## 0.7.5

### Patch Changes

- - Fix temporary balance drop during swaps by skipping `SWAP_PENDING` leaves when the event stream transitions leaves to spent
  - Add `getOwnedBalance()` to `SparkReadonlyClient` returning total owned sats including available leaves, pending outgoing transfers, and in-flight swaps

## 0.7.4

### Patch Changes

  - Retry fetch on network errors in SSP client for improved reliability on mobile and intermittent connections
  - Initialize WASM in transaction construction calls for browser environments
  - Make `receiverIdentityPublicKey` required on `LeafKeyTweak` — structural refactor that removes parameter threading across internal functions

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Fix gRPC connection leak
- Default network in unilateral exit helper to regtest instead of local when no network is provided
- Two new public methods for deposit monitoring:

  - queryStaticDepositAddresses() — fetch all static deposit addresses registered for the wallet
- Bitcoin transaction construction for node and refund transactions now delegates to the Rust WASM library instead of TypeScript.
- Implement one call cooperative exit flow
- Refactor leaf management. Three balances now returned:
  - available: immediately spendable sats balance
  - owned: all leaves owned (available + locked in outgoing transfers/swaps)
  - incoming: pending inbound balance

## 0.6.7

### Patch Changes

- Export readonly types

## 0.6.6

### Patch Changes

- - Single-call transfer claiming — claimTransfer() now completes the entire receive flow in one RPC round-trip, replacing the previous multi-step
    key-tweak/sign-refunds/finalize sequence (#5193)
  - sparkInvoice on LightningReceiveRequest — New optional field provides direct access to the Spark invoice embedded in a Lightning receive request, without needing to
    decode the Lightning invoice manually (#5393)
  - Batch token consolidation — optimizeTokenOutputs() now consolidates outputs across multiple token identifiers in a single transaction instead of one token per call.
    New acquireOutputsBatch() method on TokenOutputManager enables atomic multi-token output locking (#5235)
  - Multi-UTXO deposit proto support — New InputSigningData type and additionalOnChainUtxos/additionalInputs fields for future multi-UTXO deposit flows (#5366)

## 0.6.5

  - Introduce `createLightningHodlInvoice` for hold invoice support

## 0.5.9

### Patch Changes

- - Embedded Spark Invoices in Lightning: Added includeSparkInvoice parameter to createLightningInvoice() allowing Spark invoices to be embedded in Lightning invoice
    routing hints for easier payment tracking. Mutually exclusive with includeSparkAddress.
  - Pending Outbound Token Queries: Added pending_outbound field to queryTokenOutputs responses, allowing clients to see token outputs pending outbound transfers.
  - SE Withdrawal Signatures for Tokens: Token outputs now include se_finalization_adaptor_sig and se_withdrawal_signature fields to enable offline L1 withdrawal
    capability for BTKN token holders.
  - Transfer Signing Hash Collision Fix: Fixed an issue with transfer signing payload hash collisions that could cause signature validation failures.
  - SO1 Endpoint Update: Updated SO1 to use the Breeze Signing Operator.
  - Instant Static Deposits: Extended UTXOSwap schema to support instant static deposit flow.

## 0.5.8

### Patch Changes

- **Swap flow updates**
  - Swaps now use the `request_swap` API with outbound transfer IDs and multi-target amounts, and the SDK initiates swap transfers with adaptor signatures.
  - Added support for `COUNTER_SWAP_V3` transfers and updated swap processing to use adaptor-added signatures from the swap transfer response.
- **Deposit tree creation API update**
  - Uses `get_signing_commitments` + `finalize_deposit_tree_creation` and sends user signatures/commitments directly (no local signature aggregation).
- **Coop exit signing fix**
  - Added multi-input Taproot sighash support for connector-based refund transactions and include connector transaction data in coop exit requests.
- **Token transaction querying**
  - Split `queryTokenTransactions`
    - `queryTokenTransactionsByTxHashes` for confirming and querying the specific state of transactions
    - `queryTokenTransactionsWithFilters` for querying the network with filters. Includes cursor pagination
  - `queryTokenTransactions` is now deprecated.
- **Utilities and validation**
  - Added `hashstructure` tagged hash helper, validated VSS proof lengths, and skip direct refund tx creation for zero-timelock nodes.

## 0.5.7

### Patch Changes

- - Improvements to build types

## 0.5.6

### Patch Changes

- ### Direct Refund Transaction Fix for Zero Nodes

  Fixed an issue where the SDK was creating `directRefundTx` for nodes with `timelock=0` (zero nodes), which caused backend validation errors. The SDK now correctly skips parsing `directNodeTx` for zero nodes, matching the server-side validation logic.

  ### Improved Unilateral Exit Fee Estimation

  Reduced unilateral exit fees by an average of 56% by improving transaction size estimation. The previous logic was overly conservative; this change uses TX-specific fields for size calculation instead of generic estimates.

  ### Token Output Manager

  Added a dedicated `TokenOutputManager` class for fine-grained token output locking and management.

  **Key improvements:**
  - Per-output locking instead of global mutex, enabling concurrent token operations
  - Per-token output syncing with targeted sync support
  - Partial output updates: update outputs for specific tokens without replacing all data
  - Per-token pending-withdrawal tracking
  - Automatic lock expiry mechanism (default: 30 seconds, configurable via `tokenOutputLockExpiryMs`)

## 0.5.5

### Patch Changes

- - Fix: ensure direct-from-CPFP refund transactions are signed even when directTx is missing.
  - Improvement: increase embedded WASM stack size to 3MB (bindings regenerated) to reduce stack overflow failures.

## 0.5.4

### Patch Changes

- **Token transactions utilities**
  - Added `broadcastTokenTransactionDetailed()` method that returns detailed transaction information including `tokenIdentifier`, `commitStatus`, `commitProgress`, `finalTokenTransaction`, and `finalTokenTransactionHash`
  - Added `broadcastTokenTransactionV3Detailed()` method that returns the full `BroadcastTransactionResponse` including `tokenIdentifier` and `finalTokenTransaction`
  - Exported `hashFinalTokenTransaction` utility function from package utils for computing transaction hashes
  - Updated existing `broadcastTokenTransaction()` and `broadcastTokenTransactionV3()` to internally use the detailed methods and extract just the transaction hash for backward compatibility

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- - Transfers: SparkWallet.getTransfers() now supports optional time filtering via createdAfter?: Date or createdBefore?: Date (mutually exclusive; providing both throws).
  - TypeScript packaging: subpath exports now include explicit types mappings (notably @buildonspark/spark-sdk/types, /test-utils, /proto/spark, /proto/spark_token) to improve TS type resolution across ESM/CJS.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- **getBalance**
  - Return extraMetadata in token metadata fields on getBalance()

  **error handling**
  - Add a public getContext() method

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- **Retry gateway errors**
  - Retry on 502, 503, 504 errors as these can temporarily occur when the service is autoscaling
  - Includes exponential backoff with a max of 5 retries and a base delay of 1000ms

  **Direct refund transactions**
  - Do not construct the directRefundTx if the node timelock is 0

  **Lightning**
  - Added missing lightning send status

  **Token transaction v3**
  - Default to token transaction v3

  **Query token transcations**
  - Lower the default page size to 50

  **Miscellaneous tweaks**
  - Remove unused proof map in claim transfer flow
  - Only derive the public key once when signing
  - Update sats transfer flows to use Promise.all instead of looping through sequentially
  - Update grpc HTTP/2 header parsing

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- - **Error model & handling**
    - All public errors now derive from `SparkError`, with four concrete types: `SparkError`, `SparkValidationError`, `SparkRequestError`, `SparkAuthenticationError`; older classes like `NetworkError`, `RPCError`, `ValidationError`, `ConfigurationError` are no longer thrown.
    - `SparkError` accepts a flexible context object where `error` can be any `unknown`; it normalizes and stores the original error and produces concise, structured messages and `toJSON` output.
    - All public `SparkWallet` methods are now centrally wrapped, so anything thrown by internal code or third‑party libraries is surfaced as a `SparkError` (or subclass) with consistent context, making `instanceof` checks and top‑level error handling reliable and uniform.
    - OTEL tracing is now **Node‑only**: client‑side tracing is only initialized in `SparkWalletNodeJS`. Error messages in Node may include a `traceId`; browser/React Native environments no longer attempt to set up OTEL spans.
  - **Simplified error types across the SDK**
    - Service layers (GraphQL client, connection, signing, deposit, transfer, lightning, coop‑exit, token‑transactions, etc.) now consistently throw `SparkRequestError` for request/transport/API failures and `SparkValidationError` for invalid inputs or state.
    - Error context now uses strongly‑typed `operation` and `method` where applicable (e.g. RPC name and HTTP method), improving debuggability without requiring multiple bespoke error classes.
  - **Token transaction v3 support**
    - A new config flag `tokenTransactionVersion?: "V2" | "V3"` has been added (default `"V2"`).
    - Token‑related APIs that previously produced v2 `TokenTransaction` objects can now operate in a v3 mode that builds `PartialTokenTransaction` plus metadata and calls a new `broadcastTokenTransactionV3` path.
    - When `tokenTransactionVersion` is `"V3"`, token transfers/mints/creates will:
      - Construct partial token transactions including network, operator keys, withdraw bond parameters, and validity duration.
      - Sign and broadcast via `broadcast_transaction` on the token service, which finalizes the transaction on the coordinator side before returning a hash.
  - **HTLC (hash time‑locked contract) APIs**
    - `SparkWallet` now exposes a full HTLC workflow:
      - `createHTLC({ receiverSparkAddress, amountSats, preimage?, expiryTime })` to open a HTLC using your leaves, validating balance and expiry, and driving the swap flow using a Lightning service.
      - `claimHTLC(preimage: string)` to provide a preimage, complete the HTLC, and optionally auto‑claim when you are the receiver.
      - `getHTLCPreimage(transferID: string)` to deterministically compute a preimage from a transfer ID using a dedicated HTLC preimage key.
      - `createHTLCSenderSpendTx(...)` / `createHTLCReceiverSpendTx(...)` to build sender/receiver on‑chain spend transactions, including signing and final witness construction.
      - `queryHTLC({ paymentHashes?, status?, transferIds?, matchRole?, limit?, offset? })` to query HTLCs via the gRPC API.
    - `SparkSigner` now derives and stores an `htlcPreimageKey` when you call `createSparkWalletFromSeed`, and exposes `htlcHMAC(transferID)`—this underpins `getHTLCPreimage` so preimages are reproducible from wallet state.
    - HTLC timelock helpers and refund‑path helpers (`getNextHTLCTransactionSequence`, refund‑TX utilities) enforce valid timelock sequences, throwing `SparkValidationError` if the next step falls outside allowed intervals.
  - **HTLC querying validation (client‑side)**
    - `SparkWallet.queryHTLC` now validates:
      - `limit` must be between **1 and 100** if provided, otherwise a `SparkValidationError` is thrown.
      - `offset` must be **non‑negative** if provided, otherwise a `SparkValidationError` is thrown.
    - This prevents sending malformed pagination parameters to the server and surfaces clear, local validation errors instead.
  - **Proto & request validation updates**
    - In the token proto, `TokenTransaction.validity_duration_seconds` is now **optional**; the JS client continues to set it, but it no longer has to be present in all wire payloads.
    - `QueryTokenTransactionsRequest` adds validation for pagination fields:
      - `limit` must be in [0, 1000].
      - `offset` must be ≥ 0.
    - HTLC‑related proto messages and query types were updated so preimage requests can be made without always supplying sender public keys, matching the new `queryHTLC` API surface.
  - **(Rust bindings)**
    - `TransactionResult` now exposes:
      - `tx: Uint8Array`
      - `sighash: Uint8Array`
      - `inputs: TxIn[]` where `TxIn` includes a `sequence` field.
    - Allows you to inspect per‑input sequences/timelocks when calling helpers like `construct_node_tx`, `construct_refund_tx`, `construct_split_tx`, and `construct_direct_refund_tx`.
  - **Miscellaneous behavioural tweaks**
    - HTLC and refund‑sequence utilities now enforce that certain claim‑side timelocks land on specific X00/X50 boundaries, throwing `SparkValidationError` on invalid sequences.
    - Network/RPC failures in token and UTXO workflows consistently wrap unknown/third‑party errors into `SparkError` subclasses with preserved original error information and structured context.
